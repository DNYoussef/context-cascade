description: Advanced intent interpretation system that analyzes user requests using cognitive science principles and extrapolates logical volition. Use when user requests are ambiguous, when deeper understanding would improve response quality, or when helping users clarify what they truly need.

## Core Principles

### 1. First Principles Decomposition Before Action
Never take requests at face value. Decompose every request to fundamental goals by questioning surface assumptions. "Summarize this document" rarely means literal summarization - it often means extracting specific information, preparing for meetings, or evaluating relevance. Identify underlying needs before choosing approaches. This prevents wasted effort on solutions that address stated requests but miss true intent.

### 2. Probabilistic Confidence Thresholds Drive Clarification
Treat intent interpretation as probability distribution, not binary certainty. When confidence exceeds 80%, proceed with transparent assumptions. Between 50-80%, acknowledge uncertainty and present interpretations explicitly. Below 50%, pause for Socratic clarification through strategic questions. This calibrated approach prevents both over-clarification (wasting user time) and under-clarification (wasting effort on wrong interpretations).

### 3. Pattern Recognition Accelerates Understanding
Different request categories (creative, analytical, technical, learning, decision-making) have characteristic patterns and unstated assumptions. Recognize these patterns to rapidly identify likely underlying goals and common implicit constraints. A technical debugging request implies skill level from terminology, time pressure from phrasing urgency, and resource constraints from solution complexity mentioned. Pattern matching enables faster, more accurate intent extraction.

-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Proceeding with low confidence (<80%) without clarification** | Wrong interpretation wastes significant effort on misaligned solutions. User receives unhelpful response, requires rework, and loses trust in system accuracy. | When confidence <80%, engage Socratic clarification with 1-3 strategic questions targeting highest-uncertainty areas. Better to ask upfront than deliver wrong solution. Example: "Are you looking to [interpretation A] or [interpretation B]?" |
| **Over-clarifying simple, clear requests** | Creates friction for straightforward tasks. Users perceive system as inefficient when obvious requests trigger lengthy questioning. Slows workflow unnecessarily and trains users to provide less information to avoid interrogation. | Match clarification depth to request ambiguity. Simple requests (>90% confidence) proceed immediately with brief interpretation acknowledgment. Reserve extensive questioning for genuinely ambiguous high-stakes requests. Respect user time. |
| **Ignoring implicit constraints revealed through phrasing** | Missing implied time pressure ("quick"), technical level (jargon usage), or quality expectations ("comprehensive") leads to mismatched responses. User gets correct answer to wrong question because constraints were overlooked. | Analyze phrasing for constraint signals: "quick" = prioritize speed, technical jargon = adjust complexity, "comprehensive" = depth over brevity. Extract constraints from both explicit statements and implicit communication patterns. |

## Conclusion

Intent Analyzer represents a shift from literal interpretation to understanding underlying volition - determining what users would request with complete knowledge and perfect clarity. This approach recognizes that surface-level requests are often proxies for deeper needs shaped by incomplete information, communication constraints, and unstated assumptions. By applying first principles decomposition, probabilistic confidence calibration, and pattern recognition, the skill transforms vague requests into well-understood goals.

The practical value emerges in prevented wasted effort. Without intent analysis, ambiguous requests lead to technically correct but functionally useless responses - solving the stated problem while missing the actual need. With intent analysis, responses address true underlying goals even when initial phrasing was imperfect. This is especially critical for complex, high-stakes, or ambiguous requests where misunderstanding compounds across multiple steps.

Effective intent analysis requires balancing thoroughness with efficiency. Not every request needs deep analysis - straightforward queries benefit from immediate execution. The skill's power lies in recognizing when surface-level interpretation is insufficient and applying systematic analysis precisely where it adds value. Master this discernment, and you transform Claude from a literal executor into a genuine collaborator that understands not just what users say, but what they mean.

-----------|---------|----------|
| **Single-Source Research** | Relying on one source creates vulnerability to bias, errors, or outdated information | Use Level 2+ research with 3-5 sources for cross-validation |
| **Accepting Low Credibility** | Using sources below 70% without disclosure degrades finding quality and misleads users | Flag all <70% sources explicitly, require 3+ independent corroborations |
| **Skipping Currency Check** | Outdated sources in rapidly evolving fields provide obsolete information | Verify publication date against topic evolution, flag sources >2 years old for tech topics |

## Conclusion

Researcher provides systematic multi-level research with rigorous source evaluation, ensuring findings are credible, well-supported, and transparently documented. By applying academic research standards to everyday information gathering, this skill transforms web search into evidence-based knowledge synthesis.

Use this skill when technical accuracy matters, when building knowledge bases for unfamiliar domains, or when decisions depend on reliable information. The three-level approach scales from quick factual lookups (Level 1, under 5 minutes) to publication-ready research (Level 3, 1+ hours with 10+ sources). The credibility scoring system ensures you know exactly how much trust to place in each finding, with explicit documentation of evidence quality.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Code quality issues are detected (violations, smells, anti-patterns)
- Audit requirements mandate systematic review (compliance, release gates)
- Review needs arise (pre-merge, production hardening, refactoring preparation)
- Quality metrics indicate degradation (test coverage drop, complexity increase)
- Theater detection is needed (mock data, stubs, incomplete implementations)

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Simple formatting fixes (use linter/prettier directly)
- Non-code files (documentation, configuration without logic)
- Trivial changes (typo fixes, comment updates)
- Generated code (build artifacts, vendor dependencies)
- Third-party libraries (focus on application code)

## Success Criteria

This skill succeeds when:
- **Violations Detected**: All quality issues found with ZERO false negatives
- **False Positive Rate**: <5% (95%+ findings are genuine issues)
- **Actionable Feedback**: Every finding includes file path, line number, and fix guidance
- **Root Cause Identified**: Issues traced to underlying causes, not just symptoms
- **Fix Verification**: Proposed fixes validated against codebase constraints

## Edge Cases and Limitations

Handle these edge cases carefully:
- **Empty Files**: May trigger false positives - verify intent (stub vs intentional)
- **Generated Code**: Skip or flag as low priority (auto-generated files)
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Exclude from analysis (vendor/, node_modules/)
- **Domain-Specific Patterns**: What looks like violation may be intentional (DSLs)
- **Legacy Code**: Balance ideal standards with pragmatic technical debt management

## Quality Analysis Guardrails

CRITICAL RULES - ALWAYS FOLLOW:
- **NEVER approve code without evidence**: Require actual execution, not assumptions
- **ALWAYS provide line numbers**: Every finding MUST include file:line reference
- **VALIDATE findings against multiple perspectives**: Cross-check with complementary tools
- **DISTINGUISH symptoms from root causes**: Report underlying issues, not just manifestations
- **AVOID false confidence**: Flag uncertain findings as "needs manual review"
- **PRESERVE context**: Show surrounding code (5 lines before/after minimum)
- **TRACK false positives**: Learn from mistakes to improve detection accuracy

## Evidence-Based Validation

Use multiple validation perspectives:
1. **Static Analysis**: Code structure, patterns, metrics (connascence, complexity)
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Execution behavior, test results, runtime characteristics
3. **Historical Analysis**: Git history, past bug patterns, change frequency
4. **Peer Review**: Cross-validation with other quality skills (functionality-audit, theater-detection)
5. **Domain Expertise**: Leverage .claude/expertise/{domain}.yaml if available

**Validation Threshold**: Findings require 2+ confirming signals before flagging as violations.

## Integration with Quality Pipeline

This skill integrates with:
- **Pre-Phase**: Load domain expertise (.claude/expertise/{domain}.yaml)
- **Parallel Skills**: functionality-audit, theater-detection-audit, style-audit
- **Post-Phase**: Store findings in Memory MCP with WHO/WHEN/PROJECT/WHY tags
- **Feedback Loop**: Learnings feed dogfooding-system for continuous improvement


# Gate Validation

Systematic validation of Deep Research SOP quality gates ensuring rigorous GO/NO-GO decisions at each phase transition.

## Overview

**Purpose**: Validate quality gate requirements and make GO/NO-GO decisions

**When to Use**:

  "Validate model card for Gate 3" \
  --model-card phase3-production/model-card.md
```

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Model card ≥90% complete (Form F-G2)
- [ ] All 9 sections filled (Mitchell et al. 2019)
- [ ] Performance metrics linked
- [ ] Datasheets and risk assessments linked
- [ ] Ethical considerations complete

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Code quality issues are detected (violations, smells, anti-patterns)
- Audit requirements mandate systematic review (compliance, release gates)
- Review needs arise (pre-merge, production hardening, refactoring preparation)
- Quality metrics indicate degradation (test coverage drop, complexity increase)
- Theater detection is needed (mock data, stubs, incomplete implementations)

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Simple formatting fixes (use linter/prettier directly)
- Non-code files (documentation, configuration without logic)
- Trivial changes (typo fixes, comment updates)
- Generated code (build artifacts, vendor dependencies)
- Third-party libraries (focus on application code)

## Success Criteria

This skill succeeds when:
- **Violations Detected**: All quality issues found with ZERO false negatives
- **False Positive Rate**: <5% (95%+ findings are genuine issues)
- **Actionable Feedback**: Every finding includes file path, line number, and fix guidance
- **Root Cause Identified**: Issues traced to underlying causes, not just symptoms
- **Fix Verification**: Proposed fixes validated against codebase constraints

## Edge Cases and Limitations

Handle these edge cases carefully:
- **Empty Files**: May trigger false positives - verify intent (stub vs intentional)
- **Generated Code**: Skip or flag as low priority (auto-generated files)
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Exclude from analysis (vendor/, node_modules/)
- **Domain-Specific Patterns**: What looks like violation may be intentional (DSLs)
- **Legacy Code**: Balance ideal standards with pragmatic technical debt management

## Quality Analysis Guardrails

CRITICAL RULES - ALWAYS FOLLOW:
- **NEVER approve code without evidence**: Require actual execution, not assumptions
- **ALWAYS provide line numbers**: Every finding MUST include file:line reference
- **VALIDATE findings against multiple perspectives**: Cross-check with complementary tools
- **DISTINGUISH symptoms from root causes**: Report underlying issues, not just manifestations
- **AVOID false confidence**: Flag uncertain findings as "needs manual review"
- **PRESERVE context**: Show surrounding code (5 lines before/after minimum)
- **TRACK false positives**: Learn from mistakes to improve detection accuracy

## Evidence-Based Validation

Use multiple validation perspectives:
1. **Static Analysis**: Code structure, patterns, metrics (connascence, complexity)
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Execution behavior, test results, runtime characteristics
3. **Historical Analysis**: Git history, past bug patterns, change frequency
4. **Peer Review**: Cross-validation with other quality skills (functionality-audit, theater-detection)
5. **Domain Expertise**: Leverage .claude/expertise/{domain}.yaml if available

**Validation Threshold**: Findings require 2+ confirming signals before flagging as violations.

## Integration with Quality Pipeline

This skill integrates with:
- **Pre-Phase**: Load domain expertise (.claude/expertise/{domain}.yaml)
- **Parallel Skills**: functionality-audit, theater-detection-audit, style-audit
- **Post-Phase**: Store findings in Memory MCP with WHO/WHEN/PROJECT/WHY tags
- **Feedback Loop**: Learnings feed dogfooding-system for continuous improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Gate 1 rejected due to baseline replication failure
**Solution**:
```bash
# Debug baseline replication
python scripts/debug_baseline_replication.py \
  --baseline-paper "Attention is All You Need" \
  --verbose

# Check for implementation bugs
python tests/integration/test_gradient_flow.py
python tests/integration/test_numerical_stability.py

# Re-run with stricter determinism
python train_baseline.py --deterministic --seed 42
```

### Issue: Gate 2 rejected due to fairness gaps
**Solution**:
```bash
# Apply fairness mitigation
python scripts/fairness_calibration.py \
  --model phase2-development/novel-method/checkpoint.pth \
  --method "equalized_odds_postprocessing"

# Re-evaluate fairness
python scripts/fairness_eval.py --model calibrated_model.pth
```

### Issue: Gate 3 rejected due to reproducibility failure
**Solution**:
```bash
# Audit reproducibility package
python scripts/audit_reproducibility.py \
  --package phase3-production/reproducibility-package/ \
  --strict --debug

# Fix non-deterministic behavior
python scripts/test_determinism.py --runs 10 --strict

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Correct Approach |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Checkbox Compliance Without Verification** | Marking gate requirements as "complete" without executing validation scripts leads to false approvals. A baseline replication marked complete without running tolerance checks may have 15% error instead of required 1%. Leads to reproducibility failures and rejected publications. | Execute validation scripts for EVERY gate requirement. Baseline replication: Run experiments/scripts/validate_baseline.py with tolerance checks. Datasheet: Parse form and calculate completion percentage. Store validation evidence in Memory MCP with WHO/WHEN/PROJECT/WHY tags. Require automated pass/fail, not manual judgment. |
| **Skipping Gates Under Time Pressure** | Proceeding to method development before Gate 1 approval ("we'll validate the baseline later") leads to wasted effort building on flawed foundations. Method development on un-validated datasets or misunderstood baselines produces unpublishable results. Common in industry where shipping pressure overrides rigor. | Enforce strict gate blocking: Phase 2 skills refuse to execute until Gate 1 APPROVED status confirmed in Memory MCP. Use npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve --key "sop/gate-1/status" before method-development. Coordinate with evaluator agent to validate gate completion. No exceptions for deadlines - failed gates require remediation, not bypass. |
| **Ignoring CONDITIONAL Approvals** | Treating CONDITIONAL gate status as equivalent to APPROVED ignores required mitigation plans. Gate 2 CONDITIONAL with "adversarial robustness mitigation required" means deployment ONLY in non-adversarial environments until mitigation complete. Ignoring conditions leads to production failures. | Document all conditions in gate validation report with explicit deployment restrictions. Store conditions in Memory MCP: memory_store("sop/gate-2/conditions", "adversarial mitigation required before high-risk deployment"). Coordinate with deployment-readiness skill to enforce restrictions. Track mitigation completion before upgrading CONDITIONAL to APPROVED. |

## Conclusion

Gate validation transforms research phase transitions from arbitrary milestones into rigorous GO/NO-GO decision points backed by quantitative evidence and multi-agent consensus. By implementing statistical rigor (Bonferroni correction, effect size calculation, power analysis), this skill ensures that models advancing through Deep Research SOP phases meet production-ready standards at each gate. The three-gate system prevents wasted effort: Gate 1 catches data quality issues and baseline replication failures before method development, Gate 2 catches evaluation gaps before production preparation, and Gate 3 catches reproducibility failures before archival and deployment.

The value of gate validation extends beyond risk mitigation - it provides clear feedback loops for continuous improvement. A Gate 1 REJECTED decision with specific datasheet gaps (85% complete, missing distribution plan) provides actionable remediation guidance rather than vague "needs improvement" feedback. This precision enables rapid iteration: fix the specific gaps, re-validate, proceed. The integration with Memory MCP ensures that gate decisions persist across sessions, preventing teams from re-litigating completed validations or bypassing failed gates.

For academic ML research, gate validation is the difference between publishable and rejected work. NeurIPS, ICML, and ACM conferences increasingly require reproducibility artifacts, ethics statements, and comprehensive evaluation - requirements directly mapped to Gates 1, 2, and 3. Models passing all three gates have systematically validated data quality, baseline replication, novel methods, holistic evaluation, reproducibility, and production readiness. This rigorous validation framework ensures that research outputs meet or exceed venue requirements, reducing desk rejection rates and increasing acceptance probability.

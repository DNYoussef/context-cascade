6.5 THE BASIC THEOREM OF *-CALCULUS
We begin with the discrete analogue.
The Discrete Analogue of the
Basic Theorem of *-Calculus
Let h be a discrete function whose arguments a1, . . . .an
are an o-partition of fr,sj. Then the 3-average of
the following n-l *-gradients is equal to the *-gradi
Ír,sj :
ent of h over
ſh(airi) * h(ai)) / ſi (airi) * 1 (ai) 1,
i = 1, . . . ,n-l.
In view of the following theorem we say that the *-aver
age fits naturally into the scheme of *-calculus.
The Basic Theorem of *-Calculus
If D* h is "-continuous on [- r,s]-, then its *-average on
ir,si equals the *-gradient of h over [r,s], that is,
*:(Bh) = (h(s) = h(r)17 (its) = i (r)1.
The preceding theorem provides an immediate solution to
the following problem, which will motivate our definition of
the *-integral.
--- Page 53 ---
6.6 The *-Integral 43
The Basic Problem of *-Calculus
Suppose that the value of a function h is known at
an argument r, and suppose that f, the *-derivative
of h, is "-continuous and known at each number in
ir,si. Find h(s).
Solution
h(s) = h(r) + 3 (1 (s) = (r) 3 ºf .
6.6 THE *-INTEGRAL
The *-integral of a *-continuous function f on ir,sj,
by ſ*
s
denoted f, is the following number in B:
r
... ºs
[l (s) -+- 1 (r) J x M.f.

r --
We set f = 0.
r
The *-integral is a weighted *-average, since
ſr
sf = **{I, (s) = i (r)) & f{.
*
ſs
Furthermore, f equals the 3-limit of the 3-convergent
r
sequence whose nth term is
[l (km) < f(a1) 1 + ... + [l (km) < f(an-1) 1,
where a1,. . . .an is the n-fold o-partition of ir,si, and kn
is the common value of a2 + al, a3 + a2 . . . . .an + *n-1"
(If o is classically continuous and 8 = I, then the
*-integral is a Stieltjes integral.)
The *-integral is 8-additive and 8-homogeneous (Section
6.3) and is the only operator that has the following three
properties.

6.8 RELATIONSHIPS TO THE CLASSICAL CALCULUS
In this section we indicate the uniform relationships
between the corresponding notions of the *-calculus and clas
sical calculus.
For each number a in A, let à = 2 * (a). Let f be a
function with arguments in A and values in B, and set f(t) =
BT"(f(a(t))}.
Then *-lim f(x) and lim f(t) coexist, and if they do

6.9 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ANY TWO CALCULI
In this section we indicate the uniform relationships
between the corresponding notions of any two given calculi,
the *-calculus and the *-calculus.
For the *-calculus there are two generators, o and 8,
which generate arithmetics with realms A and B. For the *
calculus there are two generators, G and 3, which generate
arithmetics with realms Ā and B.
Since all arithmetics are isomorphic, there is a unique
isomorphism Tl from a-arithmetic to G-arithmetic and a unique
isomorphism T2 from 8-arithmetic to 3-arithmetic. For each
number x in A let x be the number T1(x) in Å, and for each
number y in B let y be the number T2(y) in B. For each func
tion f with arguments in A and values in B, let f be the

is an arbitrary ordered pair in f. Clearly f has arguments

The preceding observations clearly indicate that each
theorem in any given calculus has an analogue, or correspon
dent, in every other calculus. In particular, each theorem
in classical calculus has an analogue in *-calculus, and con
versely. As an illustration we state the following theorem.
First Mean Value Theorem of *-Calculus

Let f be *-continuous on and *-differentiable
at each number x in A for which r < x < s. Then
there exists a number c in A such that r < c < s

and such that equals the *-gradient of f

6.10 APPLICATIONS OF GEOMETRIC ARITHMETIC
By appropriately specifying O. and 8 one can obtain from
the *-calculus the calculi developed in Chapters l-4:
Calculus –3– —É–
classical. . . . . I I
geometric. . .. . I exp
anageometric. .exp I
bigeometric. . .exp exp
Thus, one uses geometric arithmetic on function values
in the geometric calculus, on function arguments in the ana
geometric calculus, and on both arguments and values in the
bigeometric calculus.
--- Page 58 ---
48 The *-Calculus
In defining anageometric slope (Section 3.2), we used
geometric intervals of geometric extent e, one reason for
which appears in Note 3. But the fundamental reason stems
from our desire that the anageometric calculus be the *-cal
culus for which o = exp and 8 = I, since there the *-slope
is defined by means of o-intervals of o-extent i. which
equals e.
Similarly, geometric intervals of geometric extent e
were used in defining bigeometric slope (Section 4.2) to
assure that the bigeometric calculus be the *-calculus for
which O. = 8 = exp.
Our definition of the geometric derivative (Section 2.3)
required that it be positive. The fundamental reason for the
restriction rests upon our desire that the geometric calculus
be the *-calculus for which o = I and 8 = exp, since there
the *-derivative,if it exists, must necessarily be in the
realm of 8-arithmetic, that is, in R+. A similar reason un
derlies the stipulation that the bigeometric derivative be
positive (Section 4.3).
The operators of the geometric calculus are applied only
to functions with positive values. However, a geometric-type
calculus for negative (valued) functions can easily be ob
tained by choosing Q = I and 8 = -exp.
By choosing O = -exp and 8 = I, one obtains an anageo
metric-type calculus for functions with negative arguments.
By choosing o = -exp and 8 = -exp, one gets a bigeometric
type calculus for functions with negative arguments and val
ues. Or one could, for example, choose o = -exp and 8 = exp,
thereby obtaining a bigeometric-type calculus for functions
with negative arguments and positive values.
Our emphasis, thus far, on the geometric family of cal
culi may be explained by the fact that these calculi possess
gradients and derivatives which are independent of the units
used in measuring certain magnitudes. The invariance of gra
dients and derivatives is discussed more generally in Section
9.2.
Of course an endless variety of calculi can be obtained
by using geometric arithmetic in tandem with other arithmetics.
For instance, one could choose O = exp and 8 = tanh. Other

2.7 THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS OF GEOMETRIC CALCULUS
The geometric derivative and integral are 'inversely'
related in the sense indicated by the following two theorems.
First Fundamental Theorem
If f is positive and continuous on [r,s] , and

g(x) = f, for every number x in [r,s],
r
then
Dg = f', on [r,s].

Just as the Second Fundamental Theorem of Classical Cal

Second Fundamental Theorem of Geometric Calculus useful for
evaluating geometric integrals. For example, let f(x) =
exp(1/x) and h(x) = x, for x > 0. Then f = ſh, and so

2.8 RELATIONSHIPS TO THE CLASSICAL CALCULUS
Our presentation of the geometric calculus was indepen
dent of the classical calculus, for the operators of the for
mer were not defined in terms of the operators of the latter.
However, the corresponding operators of the two calculi are
uniformly related.

2.8 Relationships to the Classical Calculus 17
Remark. For (2) we assume that [Öf] (a) exists; for (3) and
(4), that f is continuous on [r,s] .
The preceding observations clearly indicate that for
each theorem in classical calculus there is a corresponding
theorem in geometric calculus, and conversely. For example,
we have the following mean value theorem of geometric calcu
lus.
If a positive function f is continuous on [r,s]
and geometrically differentiable everywhere be
tween r and s, then between r and s there is a
number at which the geometric derivative of f
equals the geometric gradient of f over [r,s] .
The relationship of the nth-geometric derivative to the
nth-classical derivative follows the familiar pattern:

where f(x) = ln(f(x)).

THE ANAGEOMETRIC CALCULUS
3,1 INTRODUCTION
In the anageometric calculus, changes in function argu
ments and values are measured by ratios and differences, re
spectively, and the operators are applied only to functions
whose arguments are positive. However, an anageometric-type
calculus for functions with negative arguments is discussed
briefly in Section 6.10.
A positive interval is an interval [r,s] for which
0 < r < s. The geometric extent of a positive interval
[r,s] is the number s/r.
We were interested to learn that in his Principia, New
ton expressed Galileo's law of descent of freely falling bod
ies as follows: "When a body is falling,...the spaces de
scribed in proportional times are as. . .the squares of the
times." (Scholium to Corollary VI in "Axioms, or Laws of
Motion.") That is, in time intervals of equal geometric ex
tent, the distances traversed are proportional to the squares
of the times elapsed.
Heuristic guides for selecting appropriate gradients,
derivatives, averages, and integrals are discussed in Chap
ter 9.
3.2 THE ANAGEOMETRIC GRADIENT
An anageometrically-uniform function is a function that
is on R+, is continuous, and has the same classical change
over any two positive intervals of equal geometric extent.
Clearly every constant function on R+ is anageometrically
uniform.
The anageometrically-uniform functions are those express
ible in the form ln(cx"), where c and m are constants, c > 0,
and x is unrestricted in R+.
It is characteristic of an anageometrically-uniform func
tion that for each geometric progression of arguments, the
corresponding sequence of values is an arithmetic progression.
The anageometric slope of an anageometrically-uniform
18
--- Page 29 ---
3.3 The Anageometric Derivative 19
function is its classical change over any positive interval
of geometric extent e. (In Note 3 and Section 6.10 we ex
plain why e was chosen here.) The anageometric slope of the
function ln(cx") turns out to be m.
If one plots an anageometrically-uniform function h on
semi-log paper that is logarithmically scaled on the x-axis,
the result is a straight line whose classical slope equals
the anageometric slope of h. Other aspects of graphical in
terpretation will be discussed more fully in Section 6.ll.
The anageometric gradient of a function f over a posi
tive interval [r,s] is the anageometric slope of the anageo
metrically-uniform function containing (r.,f(r)) and (s,f(s)),
and turns out to be
f(s) – f(r)
in(s) - ln(r)
It is easy to verify that the anageometric gradient is
independent of the unit and origin used for measuring the
magnitudes which the arguments and values may represent, re
spectively.
The foregoing expression for the anageometric gradient
yields the indeterminate form 0/0 when r = s.
3.3 THE ANAGEOMETRIC DERIVATIVE
Throughout this section, f is assumed to be a function
defined at least on a positive interval containing the num
ber a in its interior.
If the following limit exists, we denote it by [Bf1 (a) ,
call it the anageometric derivative of f at a, and say that
f is anageometrically differentiable at a.
f(x) – f(a)
lim — .
x+a ln(x) - ln(a)
It can be proved that [Df] (a) and [pf] (a) coexist; that
if they do exist, then
[Df] (a) = [Df] (a)/ID(ln) 1 (a) = a- [Diſ] (a);
and that [Bf1 (a) equals the anageometric slope of the unique
--- Page 30 ---
20 The Anageometric Calculus
anageometrically-uniform function which is classically tan
gent to f at (a,f(a)).
Observe that [pfl (a) equals the classical derivative of
f with respect to ln at a.
The anageometric derivative of f, denoted by Df, is the
function that assigns to each number t the number [Df] (t),
if it exists.
The operator B is additive and homogeneous:
D(f + g) = Df + P9,
B(c.f) = c-pf, c constant.
If f is anageometrically-uniform, then Df has a constant
value equal to the anageometric slope of f. Indeed, only ana
geometrically-uniform functions have anageometric derivatives
R+.
that are constant on
It is worth noting that if h(x) = mx, where m is a con
stant and x > 0, then Dh = h.
3.4 THE ANAGEOMETRIC AVERAGE
Since changes in function arguments are measured by ra
tios in the anageometric calculus, one should not be surprised
that the definition of the anageometric average requires the
use of partitions in which the successive points form a geo
metric progression.
A geometric partition of a positive interval [r,s] is
any geometric progression whose first and last terms are r
and s, respectively. A geometric partition is n-fold if it
has n terms.
The anageometric average of a continuous function f on
Mºf
a positive interval [r,s] is denoted by and defined to
be the limit of the convergent sequence whose nth term is
the arithmetic average of f(a1) .. . . ,f(an) , where a1, . . . .an
is the n-fold geometric partition of [r,s] .
The arithmetic and anageometric averages are NOT iden
tical; for example, if f(x) = x, for x > 0, then
Mºf
= (s – r)/[ln(s) - ln(r)J ,
whereas
Mºf
= (s + r)/2.

The anageometric average of an anageometrically-uniform
function on [r,s] is equal to the arithmetic average of its
values at r and s, and is equal to its value at the geomet
ric average of r and s.
The anageometric average is the only operator that has
the following three properties.

3.5 THE BASIC THEOREM OF ANAGEOMETRIC CALCULUS
In view of the following theorem we say that the anageo
metric average fits naturally into the scheme of anageometric
calculus. (We forego the discrete analogue.)
The Basic Theorem of Anageometric Calculus
If ph is continuous on a positive interval [r,s],
then its anageometric average on [r,s] equals the
anageometric gradient of h over [r,s] , that is,
h(s) – h(r)
Mí(ph) = — .
r ln(s) - ln(r)

specific calculi are treated in Chapters 7 and 8. In Note 4
we discuss briefly the sigmoidal arithmetic and related cal
culi, which may prove useful in statistics and biology.
6.11 GRAPHICAL INTERPRETATIONS
Except for the concept of *-tangency introduced in Sec
tion 6.3, we have thus far treated the *-calculus not geomet
rically but analytically, which was the way we conceived it.
In this section we give two graphical interpretations of the
*-calculus.
By *-paper we mean paper that is ruled off in squares
and marked thus:
1%
For example, if o = I and 8 = exp, then *-paper is semi
log paper that is logarithmically scaled on the vertical axis.
A *-point is an ordered pair of numbers in A and B, in
that order.
ă(P1,P2),
Informally, the *-distance, between two k
points Pl and P2 is determined by plotting them on k-paper
and measuring their separation with the '3-ruler' provided
by the vertical axis. The result is a 3-nonnegative number.
(The concept of *-distance will be discussed formally in
Section l9.2.)
The *-graph of a set of *-points is the result of plot
ting them on k-paper. As expected, the *-graph of every #
uniform function is a straight line.
Consider the *-graph of a *-uniform function g whose *
slope is 8-positive. Let Pl and P2 be two distinct k-points
on g, as shown below, and let P2 be the vertex of the indi
3
cated right triangle.

50 The *-Calculus
ã(P2,P3) ã(P1,Ps).
Then the *-slope of g equals y With obvi
ous adjustments an interpretation may be provided if the *
slope of g is 8-negative. If the *-slope of g is 6, then the
*-graph of g is horizontal.
In Section 6.3 we observed that the k-derivative of a
function f at an argument a is equal to the *-slope of the *
uniform function g that is k-tangent to f at (a,f(a)). The
*-graph would look like this:
B
>A
The purely arithmetic nature of the *-average surely ob
viates a graphic interpretation thereof.
Now we interpret the k-integral. All references here to
geometric figures are intended to apply to figures as they
appear on k-paper. The *-area of a rectangle is defined to
be the 8-product of its '+-length' and 'w-width. ' The *
area of a unit square (i.e., a square whose sides all have
length i) turns out to be i. If a rectangle can be decom
posed into n unit squares, then its *-area equals n, as ex
pected.

Let f be a 3-positive, k-continuous function on

and let S be the region, on *-paper, bounded by the *-graph
of f, the horizontal axis, and the vertical lines at r and s.
By using o-partitions, rectangles, and the 3-limit process,
one can readily define the *-area of S, which turns out to
ſ*
s
be f.
r
Another graphic interpretation of the *-calculus may be
obtained by using Cartesian paper, by which we mean paper
that is ruled off in squares and marked thus:
-1 0 1
-1
The C-graph of a *-point (a,b) is the graph of the point
(a^*(a),87°(b)) on cartesian
paper. The C-graph of a set of
*-points consists of the C-graphs of all the individual *
points. The C-graph of each *-uniform function is a straight
line.
If Pl and P2 are *-points and t is the Euclidean dis
tance between their C-graphs, then the *-distance between Pl
and P2 equals 8(t) .
If f is a k-uniform function and m is the classical
slope of its C-graph, then the *-slope of f equals 3(m).
ir,si,
If f is a 3-positive, k-continuous function on
and w is the (usual) area of the region bounded by the C
graph of f, the horizontal axis, and the vertical lines at
a"(r) a *(s),
and then a

f = 8(w) .

THE QUADRATIC FAMILY OF CALCULI
7.1 THE QUADRATIC ARITHMETIC
In this chapter we obtain three specific calculi from
the *-calculus by using the classical and quadratic arith
metics.
Quadratic arithmetic is the arithmetic generated by
the function that assigns to| each number x the number
Vx if x > 0
x1/2
0 if x
-V-x if x < 0
That function is on R, onto R, and one-to-one; its in
verse assigns to each number x the number

- x if x > 0
x* =
0 if x = 0
-x if x < 0

Q-progressions and Q-partitions in Section 5.3.
Quadratic arithmetic is a member of the infinite family
of power arithmetics discussed in Note 5.
7.2 THE QUADRATIC CALCULUS
The quadratic calculus is the *-calculus determined by
the ordered pair * whose members are classical arithmetic
and quadratic arithmetic, in that order.
In the quadratic calculus, the operators are applied to
functions with arguments and values in R, *-limits and *
continuity are identical with classical limits and classical
continuity, the isomorphism 1 is the generator of quadratic
arithmetic, and the 8-change of a function f over [r,s] is
equal to 17:
{{f(s) +- - tº j=º\l’/2,

positive if f(s) > f(r).

If [Df] (a) does exist, it equals the quadratic slope of T,

7.3 THE ANAQUADRATIC CALCULUS
The anaquadratic calculus is the *-calculus determined
by the ordered pair * whose members are quadratic arithmetic

In the anaquadratic calculus the operators are applied
to functions with arguments and values in R, *-limits and *
continuity are identical with classical limits and classical
continuity, the isomorphism l is the inverse of the genera
tor of quadratic arithmetic, and the 8-change of a function
f over [r,s] equals f(s) - f(r), since here 8 = I.

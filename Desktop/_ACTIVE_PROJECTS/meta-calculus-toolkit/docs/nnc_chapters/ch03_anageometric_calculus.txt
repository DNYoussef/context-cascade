THE GEOMETRIC CALCULUS
2.1 INTRODUCTION
During the Renaissance many scholars, including Galileo,
discussed the following problem:
Two estimates, l0 and 1000, are proposed as
the value of a horse. Which estimate, if any,
deviates more from the true value of loO2
The scholars who maintained that the deviations should
be measured by differences concluded that the estimate of 10
was closer to the true value. However, Galileo eventually
maintained that the deviations should be measured by ratios,
and he concluded that the two estimates deviated equally from
the true value.

Now let us consider a more sophisticated problem. At
time r, a man invests f(r) dollars with a promoter who guar
antees that at a certain subsequent time s, the value of the
investment would be f(s) dollars. In event that the investor
should desire to withdraw at any other time t, it was agreed
that the value of the investment increases continuously and
uniformly. The problem is this: How much, f(t), would the
investor be entitled to at time t? We shall give two reason
able solutions; there is no unique solution.
Solution 1. Since it was agreed that the value of the invest
ment increases uniformly, we may reasonably assume that it in
creases by equal amounts in equal times. Since it was agreed,
furthermore, that the value of the investment increases con
tinuously, it can be proved that the growth must be linear
and, in fact, that
f(s) – f(r)
f(t) = f(r) + | — (t - r).
s - r
Notice that the expression within the brackets represents the
classical gradient of f over [r,s] .
Solution 2. Since it was agreed that the value of the invest
ment increases uniformly, we may reasonably assume that it in

creases by equal percents in equal times. Since, furthermore,
the value of the investment increases continuously, it can be
proved that the growth must be exponential and, in fact, that

f(t) = f(r)-

We shall see that the expression within the brackets is of
fundamental importance in geometric calculus.
In the geometric calculus, changes in function arguments
and values are measured by differences and ratios, respec
tively, and the operators are applied only to positive func
tions. Therefore, every function in this chapter is positive,
except for the natural logarithm function, ln, which is used
for special purposes. Lest the reader be disappointed by
such a restriction, we hasten to say that a geometric-type
calculus for negative (valued) functions is discussed briefly
in Section 6.10.
Heuristic guides for selecting appropriate gradients,
derivatives, averages, and integrals are discussed in Chapter
9.
2.2 THE GEOMETRIC GRADIENT
The geometric change of a positive function f over [r,s]
is the number f(s)/f(r).
A geometrically-uniform function is a positive function
that is on R, is continuous, and has the same geometric change
over any two intervals of equal classical extent. Clearly
every positive constant function on R is geometrically-uniform.
The geometrically-uniform functions are those expressible
in the form exp(mx + c), where m and c are constants and x is
unrestricted in R. If p is a positive constant, then the func
tions pºk** are also geometrically-uniform, for they are ex
pressible in the form indicated.
It is characteristic of a geometrically-uniform function
that for each arithmetic progression of arguments, the corre
sponding sequence of values is a geometric progression. That
fact provides one reason for the name "geometric calculus";
another reason will appear in Section 2.4.
--- Page 21 ---
2.3 The Geometric Derivative ll
The geometric slope of a geometrically-uniform function
is its geometric change over any interval of classical extent
l. For example, the geometric slopes of the functions
exp(mx + c) and p*** turn out to be e" and p", respectively.
If one plots a geometrically-uniform function h on semi
log paper that is logarithmically scaled on the y-axis, the
result is a straight line whose classical slope equals the
natural logarithm of the geometric slope of h. Other aspects
of graphical interpretation will be discussed more fully in
Section 6.ll.
The geometric gradient of a positive function f over
[r,s] is the geometric slope of the geometrically-uniform
function containing (r,f(r)) and (s,f(s)), and turns out to
be
l
[...]"
f(r)
Clearly the geometric gradient is independent of the
origin and unit used for measuring the magnitudes that the
arguments and values may represent, respectively.
The foregoing expression for the geometric gradient
yields the indeterminate form 1" when r = s, in contrast to
the indeterminate form 0/0 yielded by the expression for the
classical gradient.
2.3 THE GEOMETRIC DERIVATIVE
Throughout this section, f is assumed to be a positive
function defined at least on an interval containing the num
ber a in its interior.
If the following limit exists and is positive, we de
note it by [Bf1 (a), call it the geometric derivative of f at
a, and say that f is geometrically differentiable at a:
l
f(x) x-a
lim
-
x+a |f(a)
It is possible for the preceding limit to be 0 (this
l/3
happens, for example, if f(x) = exp(-x ) and a = 0). Our
--- Page 22 ---
l2 The Geometric Calculus
reason for requiring [5f] (a) to be positive will be given in
Section 6.10.
It can be proved that (DfI (a) and [5f] (a) coexist; that
is, if either exists then so does the other. Moreover, if
they do exist, then [5f] (a) equals expſ (Df) (a)/f(a) } and
equals the geometric slope of the unique geometrically-uni
form function that is classically tangent to f at (a,f(a)).
(Incidentally, the expression [Df] (a)/f(a) represents the
so-called logarithmic derivative of f at a, which is not a
non-Newtonian derivative according to our use of the term.)
The geometric derivative of f, denoted by fif, is the
function that assigns to each number t the number [5f] (t),
if it exists.
If f is geometrically-uniform, then 5f has a constant
value equal to the geometric slope of f. Indeed, only geo
metrically-uniform functions have geometric derivatives that
are constant on R. In particular, if f is a positive con
stant function on R, then if is everywhere equal to l.
Since 5(1 + 1) # B(1) + f(1), the operator 5 is not
additive; however 5 is multiplicative:
5(f.g) = 5f.5g.
Furthermore,
fi(fºy (5f)*,
- C COnstant.
Recalling that the function exp equals its classical de
rivative, we point out that the function exp[exp(x) | equals
its geometric derivative.
In Note l we define the relative gradient, which is in
timately related to the geometric gradient, is often called
the compound growth rate,and gives rise to the relative de
rivative.
2.4 THE GEOMETRIC AVERAGE
The geometric calculus was so named principally because
the geometric average fits naturally thereinto, a fact that
will be explained in the next section.

The geometric average of a geometrically-uniform func

average of r and s.
The geometric average is the only operator that has the
following three properties.

tion h(x) = b on [r,s],

2.5 THE BASIC THEOREM OF GEOMETRIC CALCULUS
Our investigation of non-Newtonian calculi began with
an observation of the simple identity indicated in the fol
lowing proposition. (In Note 2 we explain how this identity
provided the original insight into the constructibility of
the geometric calculus.)
The Discrete Analogue of the
Basic Theorem of Geometric Calculus
Let h be a discrete positive function whose arguments

In view of the preceding theorem we say that the geo

calculus.
The Basic Theorem of Geometric Calculus provides an
immediate solution to the following problem.

the geometric derivative of h, is continuous and
known at each number in [r,s] . Find h(s).

with sufficient frequency to warrant a special name, which

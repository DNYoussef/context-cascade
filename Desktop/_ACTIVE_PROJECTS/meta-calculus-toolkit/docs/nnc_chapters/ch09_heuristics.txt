THE HARMONIC FAMILY OF CALCULI
8.1 THE HARMONIC ARITHMETIC
In this chapter we obtain three calculi from the *-cal
culus by using the classical and harmonic arithmetics.
Harmonic arithmetic is the arithmetic generated by the
function that assigns to Feaºch number x the number
l if x # 0
x O if x = 0
We shall also use the notation 1/x.
Thepreceding function is on R, onto R, one-to-one, and
identical with its inverse, since
l/ (1/x) = x,
for every number x.
Harmonic arithmetic has the following features. (The
numbers y and z are arbitrary.)
Realm. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . R
Harmonic zero. . . . . . . . . . . . . 0

Harmonic division. . . . . . . . . "classical notions.

D D
Harmonic interval, Iy,z) ... All numbers x such that y G|x

D D
Harmonic extent of [y,z) ... z E]y
The following facts should also be noted: the symbol/
does not stand for harmonic division, which is identical with
classical division; harmonic order is not identical with clas
sical order (for example, -l -2); the generator of harmonic
arithmetic is not classically continuous at 0; and harmonic
convergence is not identical with classical convergence (for
instance, the infinite sequence {n} is harmonically conver
gent to 0).

60 The Harmonic Family of Calculi
Harmonic sums occur frequently in science. For example,
if two resistors of resistance y and z are connected in par
allel, the combined resistance equals the harmonic sum of y
and z.
Since the natural average and natural progressions in
harmonic arithmetic are direct extensions of the well-known
harmonic average and harmonic progressions defined for pos
itive numbers, we shall use the same names for the exten
sions.
The harmonic average of n numbers u1, . . . .un equals
l
(1/u.1) + ... + (1/un)
In
Harmonic arithmetic is a member of the infinite family
of power arithmetics discussed in Note 5.
8.2 THE HARMONIC CALCULUS
The harmonic calculus is the *-calculus determined by
the ordered pair k whose members are classical arithmetic
and harmonic arithmetic, in that order.
In the harmonic calculus the operators are applied to
functions with arguments and values in R, +-limits and *
continuity are NOT always identical with classical limits
and classical continuity, the isomorphism l is the generator
of harmonic arithmetic, and the 8-change of a function f over
[r,s] equals
l
1/f(s) – 1/f(r) '
which is 0 when f(s) = f(r).
For the remainder of this section we shall use the ad
jective "harmonic" instead of the prefix "*..."
The harmonically-uniform functions are expressible in
the form lz'(mx + c), where m and c are constants and x is un
restricted in R. The harmonic slope of the preceding func
tion equals l/m.

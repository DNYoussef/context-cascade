In view of the following theorem we say that the bigeo
metric average fits naturally into the scheme of bigeometric
calculus. (We forego the discrete analogue.)

The Basic Theorem of Bigeometric Calculus
If Éh is continuous on a positive interval [r,s],
then its bigeometric average on [r,s] equals the
bigeometric gradient of h over [r,s] , that is,

The preceding theorem provides an immediate solution to
the following problem, which will motivate our definition of
the bigeometric integral.

is known at a positive argument r, and suppose
that f, the bigeometric derivative of h, is con

SYSTEMS OF ARITHMETIC
5.1 INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we discuss the general concept of an
arithmetic, without which it would be impractical to con
struct the non-Newtonian calculi in Chapter 6. We also
present here one specific arithmetic, the geometric arith
metic, which will be used in Section 6.10. In Chapter 7
we shall discuss and use the quadratic arithmetic, and in
Chapter 8, the harmonic arithmetic.
5.2 ARITHMETICS
The concept of a complete ordered field evolved from
the axiomatization of the real number system, whose basic
ideas are assumed known to the reader." Informally, a
complete ordered field is a system consisting of a set A,
four (binary) operations, +, +, x, 7 for A, and an order
ing relation * for A, all of which behave with respect to
A exactly as +, −, x, /, & behave with respect to the set
of all numbers. We call A the realm of the complete or
dered field.
There are infinitely-many complete ordered fields,
all of which are structurally equivalent (isomorphic).
The real number system is nowadays conceived as an arbi
trarily selected complete ordered field whose realm is
denoted by R and whose operations and ordering relation
are denoted by +, −, x, /, and <.
By an arithmetic we mean a complete ordered field
whose realm is a subset of R. (Although the term "arith
metic" is commonly used for referring to the system or
study of the positive integers, we have taken the liberty
of using the term in the sense just indicated.) There are
infinitely-many arithmetics, one of which is the real num
* Complete ordered fields are discussed in many textbooks
on modern algebra and in some works on analysis. A detailed,
new axiomatic treatment of the real number system is pre
sented in the authors' Axiomatic Analysis, obtainable from
Lee Press.

ber system, henceforth called the classical arithmetic.
The rules for handling any arithmetic (A,4,-,3,7,8)
are exactly the same as the rules for handling classical
arithmetic. For example, + and x are commutative and as
sociative; x is distributive with respect to +; & is tran
sitive; and there are two unique numbers Ó and i in A such
that y + 6 = y and y x i = y, for every number y in A. The
notation "y & z" is, of course, an abbreviation of "y < z
or y = z."
Although all arithmetics are structurally equivalent,
only by distinguishing among them do we obtain suitable
tools for constructing all the non-Newtonian calculi. But
the usefulness of arithmetics is not limited to the con
struction of calculi; we believe there is a more fundamen
tal reason for considering alternative arithmetics: they
may also be helpful in developing and understanding new sys
tems of measurement that could yield simpler physical laws.
In his Foundations of Science (formerly titled, Physics:
The Elements), Norman Robert Campbell, a pioneer in the the
ory of measurement, clearly recognized that alternative arith
metics might be useful in science, for he wrote, "we must rec
ognize the possibility that a system of measurement may be ar
bitrary otherwise than in the choice of unit; there may be ar
bitrariness in the choice of the process of addition."
5.3 O-ARITHMETIC
A generator is a one-to-one function whose domain is R
and whose range is a subset of R. For example, the following
are generators: the identity function I, the function exp,
x°.
and the function
Consider any generator Q with range A. By cº-arithmetic
we mean the arithmetic whose realm is A and whose operations
and ordering relation are defined as follows.

We say that a generates a-arithmetic; for example, the
identity function generates classical arithmetic, and the
function exp generates geometric arithmetic, which is dis
cussed in Section 5.4. Each generator generates exactly one
arithmetic, and, conversely, each arithmetic is generated by
exactly one generator.
All concepts in classical arithmetic have natural coun
terparts in a-arithmetic, some of which we now discuss.
The Q-positive numbers are the numbers x in A such that
Ö & x; the g-negative numbers are those for which x & 6. The
Q-zero, ô, and the o-one, i, turn out to be o (0) and o (l).
The 2-integers consist of Ö and all the numbers that result
by successive a-addition of i to 5 and by successive a-sub
traction of i from 5. Thus the o-integers turn out to be the
following:
. . . , o,(-2), o (-1), O (0), o (l), G(2) , . . .
For each integer n, we set h = a(n). of course, if n
is an o-positive integer, then
n = i + ... + i.

number u in A such that

It turns out that u equals
(ul un)/n,
+ . . . H
which equals
a(ta" (u,) + ... + 2*(u-)1/n}.
We shall occasionally refer to the a-average as the nat
ural average in a-arithmetic. The natural average in clas
sical arithmetic is the arithmetic average; the natural aver
age in geometric arithmetic is the geometric average.
Although the o-average is widely known, we have seen no
reference to it as the natural counterpart in o-arithmetic of
the arithmetic average in classical arithmetic. Indeed, the
o-average has the same properties in the context of Q-arith
metic as the arithmetic average has in the context of classi
cal arithmetic. (An important example will be given in Sec
tion 10.4.)
An a-progression (or natural progression in a-arithmetic)
is a finite sequence of numbers ul. . . . .un in A such that
*111°
ui is the same for every integer i from 1 to n-l. In
classical arithmetic the natural progressions are the arith
metic progressions; in geometric arithmetic they are the geo
metric progressions.

An o-partition of an o-interval tr,sj is any o-progres
sion whose first and last terms are r and s. An o-partition
is n-fold if it has n terms.

there is at most one number u in A such that every o-interval

of {un] . If there is such a number u, then {un) is said to
be g-convergent to u, which is called the 2-limit of {un].
For o = I, O-convergence reduces to classical conver
gence.
5.4 GEOMETRIC ARITHMETIC
The arithmetic generated by the function exp will be
called geometric arithmetic rather than exp-arithmetic. Sim
ilarly, the notions in geometric arithmetic will be indicated
by the adjective "geometric" rather than by the prefix "exp."
For example, the natural average will be referred to as the
geometric average, a usage that is consistent with generally
accepted terminology.
In Section 6.10 we shall show that by apt use of geomet
ric arithmetic one can readily obtain the geometric calculus,
the anageometric calculus, and the bigeometric calculus.
Geometric arithmetic has the following features. (The

Geometric arithmetic should be especially useful in sit
uations where products and ratios provide the natural methods
of combining and comparing magnitudes. Of course, geometric
arithmetic applies only to positive numbers, since the range
of exp is R+. But it is a simple matter to construct a geo
metric-type arithmetic that applies to negative numbers: one
simply uses the generator -exp, which assigns to each number
x the negative number —e”.

THE *-CALCULUS
6.1 INTRODUCTION
For the remainder of this book, o and 8 are arbitrarily
selected generators and * ("star") is the ordered pair of
arithmetics (a-arithmetic, 8-arithmetic). The following
notations will be used.

It should be understood that all the definitions in
Chapter 5 apply equally well to 3-arithmetic. For example,
3-convergence is defined by means of 8-intervals and their
8-interiors.
In the *-calculus, O-arithmetic is used on arguments
and 8-arithmetic is used on values; in particular, changes
in arguments and values are measured by 0-differences and
8-differences, respectively. The operators of the *-calcu
lus are applied only to functions with arguments in A and
values in B. Accordingly, unless indicated or implied oth
erwise, all functions are assumed to be of that character.
Heuristic guides for selecting appropriate gradients,
derivatives, integrals, and averages are discussed in Chap
ter 9.
The *-limit of a function f at a number a in A is, if
it exists, the unique number b in B such that for every in
finite sequence {an} of arguments of f distinct from a, if
{an} {f(an) }
cº-converges to a, then 3-converges to b. We
write
*-lim f(x) = b.
x-oa
38
--- Page 49 ---
6.2 The *-Gradient 39
A function f is "-continuous at a number a in A if and
only if a is an argument of f and
*-lim f(x) = f(a).
x->a
When Q and 8 are the identity function I, the concepts
of *-limit and *-continuity are identical with those of clas
sical limit and classical continuity, but that is possible
even when o and 8 do not equal I.
The isomorphism from Q-arithmetic to 3-arithmetic is
the unique function l (iota) that possesses the following
three properties.
l. 1 is one-to-one.
2. l is on A and onto B.
3. For any numbers u and v in A,
1 (u + v) = 1(u) + 1 (v),
1 (u + v) = 1(u) + 1(v),
1 (u × v) = 1 (u) × 1(v),
1 (u / v) = 1(u) 7 (v), v # 5,
u < v if and only if
1(u) < 1(v).
8(a^*(x)}
It turns out that l(x) = for every number x
in A, and that 1(h) = fi for every integer n.
Since, for example, u + v = 1"(1 (u) + 1 (v)}, it should
be clear that any statement in o-arithmetic can readily be
transformed into a statement in 8-arithmetic.
6.2 THE *-GRADIENT
The 8-change of a function f over an o-interval ir,si
is the number f(s) + f(r) in B.
A *-uniform function is a function that is on A, is "
continuous, and has the same 8-change over any two o-inter
vals of equal o-extent. Clearly every constant function on
A is "-uniform.
The *-uniform functions are those expressible in the
form 1{(m x x) + c\, where m and c are constants in A and
--- Page 50 ---
40 The *-Calculus
x is unrestricted in A. By choosing m = 1 and c = 0, we see
that l is "-uniform.
It is characteristic of a *-uniform function that for
each Cº-progression of arguments, the corresponding sequence
of values is a 3-progression.
The *-slope of a *-uniform function is its 8-change
over any o-interval of o-extent i. For example, the *-slope
of the function 1{(m x x) + c) turns out to be 1(m). In par
ticular, the *-slope of l equals i, and the *-slope of a con
stant function on A equals Ö.
The *-gradient of a function f over ir,si is the *-slope
of the *-uniform function containing (r.,f(r)) and (s,f(s)),
and turns out to be
If(s) = f(r) 17Il (s) = i(r)J.
The preceding expression yields the indeterminate form
ô76
when r = s.
6.3 THE *-DERIVATIVE
Throughout this section, f is assumed to be a function
defined at least on an O-interval containing the number a in
its o-interior.
If the following *-limit exists, we denote it by [Bf (a),
call it the *-derivative of f at a, and say that f is "-dif
ferentiable at a:
*-lin{f(x) (a)]).
= f(a)17Il(x) =
x+a
(5f] (a)
If it exists, is necessarily in B.
5f,
The *-derivative of f, denoted by is the function
(551 (t),
that assigns to each number t in A the number if it
exists.
The operator 5 is 8-additive and 8-homogeneous, that is
D+ (f -+- g) = D+ f . +..• D* g,
D+ (c x- f) = c X D* f, c constant i-n B.
ºr
If f is "-uniform, then Df has a constant value equal
to the *-slope of f. Indeed, only *-uniform functions have
*-derivatives that are constant on A.
--- Page 51 ---
6.4 The *-Average 4l
Now we generalize the concept of classical tangent de
fined in Section l.3.
The *-tangent to a function f at the point (a,f(a)) is
the unique *-uniform function g, if it exists, which possess
es the following two properties:
l. g contains (a,f(a)).
2. For each *-uniform function h containing (a,f(a))
and distinct from g, there is an o-positive number
p such that for every number x in ia + p, a + pi
but distinct from a,
|g(x) = f(x)'ſ gTh(x) = f(x)'
[Bf (a)
It can be proved that exists if and only if f
[Bf (a)
has a *-tangent at (a,f(a)), and that if does exist,
it equals the *-slope of that *-tangent.
We say that two functions are *-tangent at a common
point if and only if they have the same *-tangent there.
[Bf (a)
The derivatives [DfJ (a) and do not necessarily
coexist and are seldom equal; however, if the following
exist,
ID(a") (a) , [Dal (a" (a)), ID(87%)l (f(a)), IDBI (87"(f(a)) },
r
then [Df] (a) and [Df) (a) do coexist, and the *-tangent to f
at (a,f(a)) is, if it exists, classically tangent there.
6.4 THE *-AVERAGE
The *-average of a *-continuous function f on ir,si is
**::
denoted by and defined to be the 3-limit of the 3-conver
gent sequence whose nth term is the 3-average of f(a1) . . . . .
f(an), where a1,. . . ,a is the n-fold o-partition of ir,si.
n
#:
The operator is 8-additive and 8-homogeneous (Section
6.3).
The *-average of a *-uniform function on ir,si is equal
to the 3-average of its values at r and s, and is equal to
its value at the O-average of r and s.
The *-average is the only operator that has the follow
ing three properties.

74 Heuristics
As a final example, consider a fixed light source radi
ating light uniformly in all directions. Since the intensity
of illumination is inversely proportional to the square of
the distance from the source, the relationship of intensity
to distance is describable by a bigeometrically-uniform func
tion, whose bigeometric slope is independent of the units of
distance and intensity.

COLLATERAL ISSUES
10.1 INTRODUCTION
This last chapter contains, among other things, brief
discussions of some ideas that we have entertained but not
investigated in depth.
As before, * is an ordered pair of arbitrarily selected
arithmetics, (A,4,-,3,7,8) and (B,*,+,×,7,8), having genera
tors o and 8. The isomorphism from a-arithmetic to 3-arith
metic is denoted by l, which was discussed in Section 6.l.
The o-absolute value of a number a in A is denoted by
iai a(la"(a) |)
and equals similarly, the 3-absolute value
|b| 8(IBT"(b) |),
of a number b in B is denoted by and equals
(Section 5.3).
The 8-square of a number b in B is bºb, which will be
denoted by b? at a slight risk that it might be incorrectly
interpreted as b to the power 8(2). For each 3-nonnegative
number t, the symbol “Vt will be used to denote
8(VAT"(t)},
which is the unique 3-nonnegative number whose 3-square equals
t. For each number b in B,
*/3 - is
For each integer n, the symbolsh and fi denote the a
integer o (n) and the 8-integer 8(n), respectively.
Henceforth a point is a 4-point, that is an ordered pair
of numbers in A and B, in that order. The symbol Pi repre
sents the point (ai,bi).
10.2 k-SPACE
By *-space we mean the system consisting of all points
and the following method of computing the k-distance,
d*(P1,P2), between poi-nts Pl and P2:
º, -º/-a.

-
This k-distance formula gives the same results infor
mally explained in Section 6.ll and was initially designed
to facilitate the graphic interpretation presented there.
(When o' = B = I, k-distance is obviously the usual Euclid
ean distance.) Observe that
d+(P1,P2)
is in B, as are the
values of all the operators of the k-calculus. Of course,
one could easily redefine *-distance so that it is in A,
but that would be less useful for our purposes.
If a1 = az, then ä+(P1,P2) = -|-bi + bal--; and if b1 = b,.
then ä+(P1,P2) = -|- (a1 + a2)-l- = t (- al - a21- ).
+
Although d is not a metric in the usual sense, it is a
*-metric in the sense that the following proposition is true.
For any points P1, P2, and P3,

The points Pl, P2, and P3 are *-collinear provided that
at least one of the following holds:
+ ... k. *
d(P2,P1) + d(P1,P3) = d(P2,P3),

+ -
If a1 = a2 = a3 or b1 - b2 - b3, then Pl, P2, and P3 are
*-collinear, but those are not the only circumstances that
engender k-collinearity, as we shall see shortly.
A *-line (or *-geodesic) is a set L of at least two dis
tinct points such that for any distinct points Pl and P2 in
--- Page 87 ---
10.2 *-Space 77
L., a point P2 is in L if and only if Pl, P2, and P3 are k
*
collinear. *-line is vertical provided all its points
have the same first member.
When o = 8 = I, the k-lines are the straight lines of
Euclidean analytic geometry in two dimensions. If o = I
and 8(x) = x", for example, then each nonvertical *-line is
the union of two parabolic parts. (The parabolic family of
calculi is defined in Note 6.)
Theorem
The class of nonvertical k-lines is identical
with the class of k-uniform functions.
Two º-lines are *-parallel provided they are identical
or have no common point. It turns out that two nonvertical
*-lines are *-parallel if and only if they have the same *
slope.
A k-line Pl is *-perpendicular to a *-line P2 provided
they have a common point P and for any points Pl on Ll and
P2 on L2, distinct from P, d(P1,P) < d(P1,P2). If L1 and L

are *-perpendicular, then for any points Pl On L1 and P2 on

Furthermore, two nonvertical *-lines are *-perpendicular if
and only if the 8-product of their +-slopes is +1, that is,
8(-1).
The *-arc length of a suitably behaved arc can be de
fined in an obvious way by partitioning the arc and using the
*-distance between the successive points. If f has a k-con
tinuous *-derivative on ir,si, the k-arc length of f on [r,s]
turns out to be

As expected, the *-distance between two points Pl and P2 is
equal to the *-arc length of the *-segment connecting Pl and
P2.
With the k-metric one can define all the k-conics, the
study of which may be facilitated by using the *-vectors de

fined in the next section. (It would be interesting to know
whether one can select o and 8 so that every +-circle is an
ellipse.)
Since +-space is, in fact, a model of plane Euclidean
geometry, all the theorems of the latter have counterparts
in the former. Nevertheless, we believe that it is just as
profitable to distinguish these spaces as it is to distin
guish the calculi.
Clearly the foregoing developments can be extended to
n dimensions.
In Note 7 we show how to convert the set of all points
into a system of *-complex numbers.
10.3 k-VECTORS
For any numbers a in A and b in B, the transformation
that maps each point (x,y) into (x+a, yºb) is a k-vector and
r r +
is here denoted by v[a;b) . The sum of v[a;b) and v[c;d) is
v+ [a--c, b---d] .
Theorem
*
For any point (x,y) and *-vector v [a;b) , the
point (x,y), its image (x+a, yºb), and the
latter's image (x+a+a, yºbºb), are *-collinear.
Stabl
We say that the vector is rectilinear provided
that for EVERY point (x,y), the points (x,y), (x+a, yºb) ,
and (x+a+a, yºbºb) are classically collinear; otherwise the
vector is curvilinear.
If O. = B = I, then all #-vectors are rectilinear. But,
for instance, if o = I and 8 = exp, then most k-vectors are
$17,2]
curvilinear; e.g., is curvilinear since it maps (l,3)
into (8,6), which is mapped into (15,12), three k-collinear
points that are not classically collinear.
Various types of scalar multiplications and norms can
be defined for k-vectors.
10.4 THE *-METHOD OF LEAST SQUARES
The *-method of least squares is the same kind of exten
sion of the classical method of least squares as the *-calcu
lus is of the classical calculus.
--- Page 89 ---
10.4 The *-Method of Least Squares 79
Let f be a discrete function with arguments a1,. . . .an
in A and values in B, and let S be a set of functions whose
values are in B and whose arguments are in A and include
a-l'- - - - *,a“n•
If there exists a member g of S such that for every mem
ber h of S distinct from g,
[g(a) = f(a) 1 3 ... + [g(an) = f(a) I’
< Th(a1) = f(a1) 1 + ... + [h(aa) = f(aa) 1",
then g, which is obviously unique, is said to be the member
of S that is best fitted to f by the *-method and is denoted
by f(s;f).
When O. = 8 = I, the k-method is identical with the clas
sical method and the notation L(S;f) will be used instead of
£(s; f).
Please note that L(S;f) is not necessarily a linear
function.
For each function 6 with arguments in A and values in B,
let 5 be the function consisting of all ordered pairs
(a" (x), 87°(y)) for which (x,y) is in 9. Let S be the set
of all functions à for which 6 is in s. Then itsºf) and
L(5;f, coexist, and if they do exist,
£(s;f = 3(L(5;F)).
The pattern of that relationship is already quite familiar
in view of the results given in Section 6.8.
£(s;f,
Thus, if exists, it can be found by using the
classical method to select the member of S that best fits f
and then applying 8 to the result.
Any statistical justification for the classical method
can probably be converted into a justification for the *
method.
If S is the set of all k-uniform functions, then we have
the following results.

f(s;f,
3. contains the *-centroid of f, which we
define to be the point whose members are the
o-average of the ai and the 8-average of the
f(ai),
in that order.
£(s;f)
In this situation, the *-slope of may be useful for
indicating the "overall k-direction" of the discrete func
tion f.
Consider now the problem of fitting a function of the
f:{(a1,b1),
form exp(mx + c) to a positive discrete function
. . . . (an,bn) }. Since the classical method is extremely diffi
cult to apply here, scientists use the following "lineari
zation" technique.
{(alln(b1)), ... , (an,ln(bm))},
First f is transformed into
and the functions exp(mx + c) are transformed into ln[exp(mx+
c) ) , that is, into the linear functions mx + c. Then the
classical method is used to fit a linear function to the
transformation of f, and finally exp is applied to that lin
ear function. The result, which we have not seen explained
heretofore, is identical with that provided by the *-method
for which o = I and 8 = exp.
The idea for the *-method arose from the following ana
logue of a well-known theorem concerning the arithmetic aver
age.
If b is the 3-average of n numbers b1, . . . ,bn in B,
then
(b - bi) + ... + (b = bn) = 3,
and for any number x in B distinct from b,
(b - bi)” + ... ; (b = bn)?
* (x + bi) * + ... + (x = ba)*.
Perhaps other statistical concepts can be developed in
the context of *-calculus. For example, since the *-graph
(section 6.11) of the function 8(exp(-(a"(x))”
J} is a nor
mal distribution curve, we may call that function *-normal.
If a function is not classically normal, it may be *-normal
for suitable choices of 0 and 8, in which case the tools of
the *-calculus would be available for analytic purposes.

lC).5 Trends 81
10.5 TRENDS
Although least squares methods provide interesting ways
of determining various "overall directions" of a discrete
function, there are other methods that are easier to calcu
late and may prove to be more useful. For simplicity we be
gin with functions defined on (closed) intervals, rather than
with discrete functions.
By a trend of a function on an interval we mean an aver
age of a derivative of the function on the interval. (It may
be helpful to conceive of a trend as a kind of global deriva
tive.)
For example, one could compute the quadratic average of
the classical derivative of g on [r,s] :
| l ſsº# ) l/2
S - r *r -
Or one could compute the biquadratic average of the anageo
metric derivative of g on a positive interval.
Trends that do not depend on all the points of the func
tion are trivial. For example, the arithmetic average of Dg
on [r,s] is a trivial trend, since it equals
[g(s) – g(r))/(s - r),
which depends solely on the points (r,g(r)) and (s,g(s)).
Similarly, the *-average of 5g on ir,si is a trivial trend.
Nontrivial trends are obtained only by applying an average
from one calculus to a derivative from another calculus.
One can compute trends of a discrete function f by aver
aging the slopes of the uniform functions joining successive
points of f, assuming, of course, that the arguments of f are
equispaced relative to the arithmetic used for the arguments.
For instance, one could compute the quadratic average of the
classical slopes of the linear functions connecting the suc
cessive points. (The resulting trend is related to the root
mean-square-successive-difference used by some statisticians.)
We would like to know whether there is a trend operator
that assigns to each discrete function with equispaced argu
ments the classical slope of the linear function that can be
fitted to f by the classical method of least squares.

lo.6 CALCULUS IN BANACH SPACES
Each arithmetic can be converted into a Banach space.
For example, a-arithmetic is so converted by defining the
|a" (u)
norm of each number u in A to be and by defining
the scalar product of a number r and u to be a(r) × u.
Shortly after completing our development of the non
Newtonian calculi in August of 1970, we had occasion to con
sult the first edition of Jean Dieudonné's Foundations of
Modern Analysis. There we found a definition of the deriva
tive of a function with arguments in a Banach space and val
ues in a Banach space. If those Banach spaces are taken to
be converted o-arithmetic and converted 3-arithmetic, re
spectively, then that derivative is the k-derivative. For
the integral, Dieudonné apparently restricted his attention
to functions with arguments in R and values in a Banach space.
If the Banach space is taken to be converted 8-arithmetic,
then that integral is the special *-integral for which o = I.
However, since we have nowhere seen a discussion of even
one specific non-Newtonian calculus, and since we have not
found a notion that encompasses the *-average, we are in
clined to the view that the non-Newtonian calculi have not
been known and recognized heretofore. But only the mathemat
ical community can decide that.
10.7 CONCLUSION
We trust that the basic ideas of the non-Newtonian cal
culi have been presented in sufficient detail to enable in
terested persons to develop the theory in various directions.
For example, one could study *-differential equations, inves
tigate Taylor series in the context of *-calculus, or con
struct non-Newtonian calculi of functions of two or more real
variables by choosing an arithmetic for each axis. It might
even be profitable to seek deeper connections among the cor
responding operators of the calculi. One well-known theorem
about averages comes to mind:

If the corresponding propositions for *n-derivatives and
integrals were true, then one could say that the geometric
calculus is the "limit" of an infinite sequence of calculi.
But, alas, those propositions are false. Nevertheless, it
is not unreasonable to speculate that there are nontrivial
sequences of calculi which do converge in some well-defined
sense-
Some years ago we encountered a remark by N.J. Lennes
that has become for us a constant reminder of the hazards of
premature judgment:
"Christiaan Huygens, one of the world's great
mathematicians and physicists, ... never became en
thusiastic about the calculus, and urged to the end
of his life that all problems solved by means of it
could be solved equally well by the older methods."
--- Page 94 ---
N. O. T E S
Note l (to page 12)
Those who prefer percents to ratios may find the follow
ing concepts more appealing than the corresponding concepts
of the geometric calculus. However, the relative derivative
is not a non-Newtonian derivative according to our use of the
term and there is no integral that is the 'inverse' of the
relative derivative. It should also be mentioned that the
relative derivative is not the so-called logarithmic deriva
tive, which also fails to be a non-Newtonian derivative.
The relative change of a 'positive function f over [r,s]
is [f(s) – f(r) 1/f(r), which equals l less than the geometric
change of f over [r,s] . The relative slope of a geometrical
ly-uniform function is its relative change over any interval
of classical extent l. The relative gradient of a positive
function f over [r,s] is the relative slope of the geometri
cally-uniform function containing (r.,f(r)) and (s,f(s)), and
turns out to be
l
#f(s!) )"sº-r - i.
f(r)
or l less than the geometric gradient of f over [r,s] .
In securities analysis and other applications the rela
tive gradient is often called the compound growth rate. For
example, suppose that one paid $64 for a share of stock.
Three years later the price of the share is $216. The com
pound (annual) growth rate of the price over the time inter
val [0,3] is given by
1/(3-0)
[216/64] - l,
which equals 0.5 or 50%. The significance of that figure
stems from the fact that if an original investment of $64
increased 50% in each of three successive years, the final
value would be $216.
The relative derivative of a positive function f at an
argument a is the following limit, if it exists and is great
er than -l:

The relative derivative of f at a coexists with, and equals

Note 2 (to page 13)
We shall explain here how a simple algebraic identity
led us to construct the geometric calculus. First we re
express thediscrete analogue of the Basic Theorem of Classi
cal Calculus(p.6) in a slightly different manner.
Consider any n points (a1,V1) . . . . , (an,Vn), where a1 <
1 = a3 - a.2 = .. . = an - an-1. Let
a... <... < a. and a~ - a k

be the common value of the at - a1–1, so that k(n-1) = an—a

Connect the n points by line segments, of which there are
n - l. Then the arithmetic average of their classical slopes
equals the classical slope of the line segment containing the
endpoints (a1,V1) and (an,Vn) ; that is
Now assume that the vi are positive. Then the following

The left side of that equation is the geometric average of
(v/v, 1)",
the n-1 numbers which, we imagined, must be
slopes of a new kind. We conjectured that the preceding
equation must be the discrete analogue of the Basic Theorem
of a new system of calculus, the geometric calculus.
Note 3 (to page 19)
Here we explain why, in the definition of anageometric
slope, we use positive intervals of geometric extent equal to
e, rather than to some other number greater than l. (Geomet
--- Page 96 ---
86 N O tº e s
ric extent is necessarily greater than 1.)
Let w > 1, and assume we had defined the anageometric
slope of an anageometrically-uniform function to be its clas
sical change over any positive interval of geometric extent
w. Then the anageometric slope of ln(cx"), the typical ana
geometrically-uniform function, would equal m.ln(w). Accord
ingly, it is convenient to stipulate that ln(w) = 1, or w =
e. The choice of w = e is no more arbitrary here than the
choice of intervals of classical extent l in the definition
of classical slope (Section l.2). In Section 6.10 we make
another comment on the choice w = e.
Note 4 (to page 49)
Many 'growth' calculi can be constructed by taking o =
I and choosing 8 from the growth curves, which include or
are related to the logistic curves, cumulative normal curves,
and the sigmoidal curves that occur in the study of popula
tion and biological growth.
For example, let o(x) = (e” - 1)/(e” + 1). (Note that
o(2x) = tanh(x).} The function o is of the sigmoid type (S
shaped) and generates sigmoidal arithmetic, whose realm con
sists of all numbers strictly between -l and l. The sigmoid
al sum and difference of numbers u and v in the realm turn
out to be (u + v), (l 4 uv) and (u - v)/(1 - uv), respectively.
The sigmoidal calculus is the *-calculus for which o = I and
8 = 0. By choosing G = 0 and 8 = I we get the anasigmoidal
calculus; for a = 8 = q we obtain the bisigmoidal calculus.
It is entertaining to extend sigmoidal arithmetic by
appending -l and 1 to the realm and defining the sum of num
bers u and v to be
(u + v), (l + uv) if uv # -l
u ž v =
-
0 if uv = -l
Then l 4 (–1) = 0; if u ž -l, then u + 1 = 1; and if u ž 1,
then u + (-1) = -1. Thus, -l and 1 behave as negative and
positive infinity in the extended sigmoidal system.
If units are chosen so that the speed of light is l,
then the extended sigmoidal sum of two speeds equals the
relativistic composition of the speeds, even if one or both

the pth-power function is the function x”, which generates
the parabolic arithmetic (Note 6).
The pth-power function is one-to-one, is on R and onto

Note 7 (to page 78)
The system of *-complex numbers consists of all 4
points and two operations defined thus: the sum of (a1,b1)
and (a2,b2) ls (al + a2. bl + b2) and their product is
(a(a1a2 - 5152}, 3(a152 + 51a2}),
*(al), *(b1),
where a -1 = a- a-2 = a-l(a2), b -1 = 6- and b -2 -
For this system, which is a field, one can define sub
traction and division that are 'inverses' of addition and
multiplication. Furthermore, O-arithmetic (and hence every
arithmetic) is embedded in the system.
Since the product of (0,i) with itself equals (-1,0),
* - --
we may define i to be (0,1) . Of course, the product of
(ó,-1) with itself also equals (-1,0).
Various types of moduli can be defined for the *-complex
numbers.

BIBLIOGRAPHY
Grossman, M. The First Wonlinear System of Differenttal
and Integral Calculus. Rockport, MA: Mathco, l979.
This book contains a detailed account of the geometric calcu
lus, which was the first of the non-Newtonian calculi. Also
included are discussions of the analogy that led to the dis
covery of that calculus, and some heuristic guides for its ap
plication.
Meginniss,“J. R. "Non-Newtonian Calculus Applied to Prob
ability, Utility, and Bayesian Analysis." Proceedings of the
American Statistical Association: Business and Economics Sta
tistics Section (1980), pp. 405-4lo.
This paper presents a new theory of probability suitable for
the analysis of human behavior and decision making. The theo
ry is based on the idea that subjective probability is govern
cd by tho laws of a non-Newtonian calculus and one of its cor
responding arithmetics.
Grossman, J., Grossman, M., and Katz, R. The First Sys
tems of Weighted Differential and Integral Calculus. Rock
port, MA: Archimedes Foundation, 1980.
This monograph reveals how weighted averages, Stieltjes inte
grals, and derivatives of one function with respect to another
can be linked to form systems of calculus, which are called
weighted calculi because in each such system a weight function
plays a central role.
Grossman, J. Meta-Calculus ; Differential and Integral.
Rockport, MA: Archimedes Foundation, 1981.
This monograph contains a development of systems of calculus-,
called meta-calculi, that transcend the classical calculus,
for example in the following manner. In each meta-calculus
the gradient, or average rate of change, of a function f on an
interval [r,s] depends on all the points (x,f(x)) for which
r 3 x < s, whereas the classical gradient (f(s) - f(r) J/(s - r)
depends only on the endpoints (r,f(r)) and .(s,f(s)) . . The meta
calculi arose from the problem of measuring stock-price per
formance when taking all intermediate prices into account.
Grossman, M. Bigsometric Calculus: A System with a Scale
Frea Derivative. Rockport, MA: Archimedes Foundation, l983.
This book contains a detailed treatment of the bigeometric
calculus, which has a derivative that is scale-free, i.e.,
invariant under all changes of scales (or units) in function
arguments and values. Also included are heuristic guides for
the application of that calculus, and various related matters
such as the bigeometric method of least squares.
Grossman, J., Grossman, M., and Katz, R. Average•* 4 New
Approach. Rockport, MA: Archimedes Foundation, l?83.
This monograph is primarily concerned with a comprehensive- -
family of averages (unweighted and weighted) of functions
that arose naturally in the development of non-Newtonian
calculus and weighted,non-Newtonian calculus. The monograph
also contains discussions of some heuristic guides for the
appropriate use of averages and an interesting family of
means"of two positive numbers.

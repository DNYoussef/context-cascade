the following problem, which will motivate our definition of
the anageometric integral.
The Basic Problem of Anageometric Calculus
Suppose that the value of a function h is known
at a positive argument r, and suppose that f,
the anageometric derivative of h, is continuous
and known at each number in [r,s] . Find h(s).
Solution
h(s) = h(r) + (ln(s) - ln(r)J.M.f.

ln(r)]-Mºf
a positive interval [r,s] is the number [ln(s) -

dient of f over [r,s] .) Then we have the following uniform

The preceding observations clearly indicate that for
each theorem in classical calculus there is a corresponding
theorem in anageometric calculus, and conversely.

THE BIGEOMETRIC CALCULUS
4.1 INTRODUCTION
In the bigeometric calculus, changes in function argu
ments and values are measured by ratios, and the operators
are applied only to functions with positive arguments and
positive values. However, bigeometric-type calculi for oth
er functions can be constructed (Section 6.10).
Heuristic guides for selecting appropriate gradients,
derivatives, averages, and integrals are discussed in Chap
ter 9.
4.2 THE BIGEOMETRIC GRADIENT
A bigeometrically-uniform function is a positive func=
tion that is on R+, is continuous, and has the same geomet
ric change over any two positive intervals of equal geomet
ric extent. Clearly every positive constant function on R+
is bigeometrically-uniform.
The bigeometrically-uniform functions are those express
cx",
ible in the form where c and m are constants, c > 0, and
x is unrestricted in R+.
It is characteristic of a bigeometrically-uniform func
tion that for each geometric progression of arguments, the
corresponding sequence of values is also a geometric progres
sion.
The bigeometric slope of a bigeometrically-uniform func=
tion is its geometric change over any positive interval of
geometric extent e. (Our reason for choosing e here is sim
ilar to the reason for using e in defining anageometric slope,
as explained in Note 3 and Section 6.10.) The bigeometric
slope of the function cx" turns out to be e".
If one plots a bigeometrically-uniform function h on
log-log paper, the result is a straight line whose classical
slope equals the natural logarithm of the bigeometric slope
of h. Other aspects of graphical interpretation will be dis
cussed more fully in Section 6.ll.
The bigeometric gradient of a positive function f over a

26 The Bigeometric Calculus
positive interval [r,s] is the bigeometric slope of the bi
geometrically-uniform function containing (r.,f(r)) and
(s,f(s)), and turns out to be
ſº
f(r)
It is easy to verify that the bigeometric gradient is
independent of the units used for measuring the magnitudes
which the arguments and values may represent.
The foregoing expression for the bigeometric gradient
yields the indeterminate form 1” when r = s.
4.3 THE BIGEOMETRIC DERIVATIVE
Throughout this section, f is assumed to be a positive
function defined at least on a positive interval containing
the number a in its interior.
If the following limit exists and is positive, we de
note it by [ſif] (a), call it the bigeometric derivative of f
|##!"
at a, and say that f is bigeometrically differentiable at a:
[ln(x)-ln(a)]
lim
x+a f(a)
Our reason for requiring [[f] (a) to be positive will be in
dicated in Section 6.10.
It can be proved that [Df1 (a) and [ºf] (a) coexist; that
if they do exist, then
[ºf] (a) = expſa. [Df] (a)/f(a) };
and that [ºf] (a) equals the bigeometric slope of the unique
bigeometrically-uniform function which is classically tan
gent to f at (a,f(a)).
The bigeometric derivative of f, denoted by ºf, is the
function that assigns to each number t the number [ºf] (t),
if it exists.
The operator 5 is multiplicative:
Í (f-g) = \f. §g.
Furthermore,
E(fº = (ºf)‘’, c constant.

4.4 The Bigeometric Average 27
£f
If f is bigeometrically-uniform, then has a constant
value equal to the bigeometric slope of f. Indeed, only bi
geometrically-uniform functions have bigeometric derivatives
R+.
that are constant on
It is also worth noting that if h(x) = exp(x) for x > 0,
then ºh = h.
We noted above that
[[f] (a) exp[a• [Df1 (a)/f(a) }.
Since economists refer to the expression within the braces as
the elasticity of f at a, we call [f] (a) the resiliency of f
at a. We believe that resiliency will prove to be more use
ful than elasticity because the former is the derivative in a
complete system of calculus (the naturalness of which is ex
hibited in this chapter), whereas it appears to be impossible
to construct a complete, natural system of calculus in which
the derivative is the elasticity.
Perhaps the psychophysicists will find some interest in
the bigeometric calculus, for one of their basic laws may be
stated thus: The resiliency of the stimulus-sensation func
tion is constant. (That constant is determined by the nature
of the stimulus.)
The bigeometric calculus may also prove to be useful in
biology, for a fundamental law of growth is the following:
If f is the function relating the size of one organ to the
size of any other given organ in the same body at the same
instant, then, within certain time limits, the resiliency of
f is constant.
A physicist who preferred not to settle on specific units
of time and distance could, nevertheless, assert that the bi
geometric speed of an object falling freely to the earth is
COnStant.
Heuristic guides for selecting appropriate derivatives
are discussed more fully in Section 9.2.
